# Time Waster

This is Time Waster. It's an attempt at a short 'RPG' style video game. As you play you will progress through a short quest chain, culminating in a final boss fight. This game is written in Javascript, using the Phaser3 framework.

# Gameplay

Players can do the following:
    - move
    - light attack '1'
    - heavy attack '2'
    - interact with objects
      - herb sprite on the ground
      - tree sprite in the beginning zone
      - loot 'Nepian Observers'
      - loot 'Electro Lord Kealthis'

# How to Play

To play, walk up to the wizard NPC on the screen with the bouncing 'quest' icon above its head.

IF YOU SEE A BOUNCING QUEST ICON IT MEANS YOU CAN ACCEPT A QUEST
  - click on the wizard
  - click on the main dialogue directly
  - click exit or accept at any time or when prompted
  - complete the quests
  
IF YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE QUEST, GO BACK TO THE NPC AND CLICK ON IT AGAIN
  - it should guide you to the next quest
